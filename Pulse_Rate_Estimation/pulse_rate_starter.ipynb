    "\n",
    "The code is composed of different functions which work together to estimate the errors and confidence associated with heart rate estimations from photoplethysmogram (ppg) and accelerometer signals and compared to some reference heart rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use the code, simply run the **Evaluate()** function which calls the functions to load the TROIKA datasets, extracts the signals, applies bandpass filters to them, generates features and then runs the **RunPulseRateAlgorithm()** to estimate the heart rates, and then computes the errors between the estimated heart rates and the reference values and also calculated the associated confidences. Lastly, it aggregate the errors by calling the **AggregateErrorMetric()**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets used were sourced from Zhang et. al (2015) and are composed on ppg and three accelerometer signals in x-, y- and z- directions sampled 125Hz. The datasets were acquired from subjects aged 18 - 35 years. The reference heart rates used as  the ground truth were ECG acquired in 8s window simultaneously as the other signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Activities: rest for 30s followed by run for 4 minutes on a treadmill with speed varied every 1 minute and lastly, rest for 30s\n",
    "\n",
    "> Features of Sensor Used: All the signals were sampled at 125Hz. The ppg signals were acquired from the wrist using two pulse oximeters with green LEDS of wavelength 515nm separated by a 2cm distance and accelerometer signals were acquired from the wrist in three axis. The ECG signals were acquired in 8s window simultaneously as the other signals\n",
    "\n",
    "> Quantity of data in the dataset: dataset contains 12 data files and 12 reference files (from 11 subjectes). Each of the data files contains 6 rows representing ECG, 2 channels of PPG and 3 recording of 3-dimensional accelerometer signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Shortcomings of the dataset: dataset was based on limited fixed activities (as above), the experiment was not performed in a free-style context that could mimic the wearer's daily routine.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm description**\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed under the code description, the core of the algorithm is the **RunPulseRateAlgorithm()** function which estimates the heart rates, compares them with the gorund truth, computes the associated errors and confidence for a given data_file and reference_file. The errors are aggregated for all the datafiles and reference files by the **AggregateErrorMetric()** function which returns the mean error of the best pulse rate estimates (@ 90% percentile). Both of these functions are called by the **Evaluate()**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **LoadTroikaDataFile(data_fl)** and the **ground_truth(ref_fl)** functions load the input signals and reference heart rates respectively for each pair of locations returned by the **LoadTroikaDataset()** function. The **bandpass_filter()** filters the input signals within the specified limits of 40Hz and 240Hz. The **feature_generator(signal, fs)** function generates features such as Fourier transforms of the signals, their peak values, the frequencies of the peaks, etc. from the bandpass filtered signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Description of the Physiology: The PPG sensor is equipped with LEDs that emits (green) lights which are absorbed by red-blood cells as blood flows in and out of the capillaries in the wrist. The amount of reflected light detected by the photodetector in the ppg sensor changes as the volume of bloods into the capillaries in the wrist changes during each phase of a heart-beat resulting in an oscillating waveform, the period of which is the pulse rate. Arm swings associated with the wearer's movements can also be seen as periodic signals on the PPG sensor. Such signals can be tracked using accelerometer which only senses arm motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "> An intuitive explanation of why the confidence algorithm produces a higher number for better estimates: \n",
    "The confidence algorithm produces a higher number for better estimates because we are able to pick strong frequencies of the ppg signal that not present in the accelerometer at the better/best estimates. Since confidence interval was calculated as the sum of the magnitude of the estimated 'strong' frequency spectrum divided by the sum of the magnitude of the entire frequency spectrum of the ppg signals, the more strong frequencies we picked, the higher the confidence level and the better the pulse rate estimates.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Insightful caveats and failure-modes of the algorithm: The algorithm is based on estimation of strong frequency spectral in the ppg signals relative to the entire frequency spectral of the ppg signals. The wearer's motion can produce strong signals which can be confused for the pulse rate resulting in algorithm failure.  \n",

    "**Algorithm performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean absolute error (MAE) at 90% availability using the confidence estimates for best estimates. The MAE was calculated by comparing  heart rates estimated in 8s window with the given reference values (ground) in the same window length. The value of the error was 13.63 which was below the 15bpm required margin. \n",
    "\n",
    "The performance metric reported here was based on a heuristic model built on a limited dataset. Thus, it may not be generalisable to handle other datasets.\n",
